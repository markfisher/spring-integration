Spring Integration
==================

# Checking out and Building

To check out the project and build from source, do the following:

    git clone git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-integration.git
    cd spring-integration
    ./gradlew build

If you encounter out of memory errors during the build, increase available heap and permgen for Gradle:

    GRADLE_OPTS='-XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -Xmx1024m'

To build and install jars into your local Maven cache:

    ./gradlew install

To build api Javadoc (results will be in `build/api`):

    ./gradlew aggregatedJavadoc

To build reference documentation (results will be in `docs/build/reference`):

    ./gradlew reference

To build complete distribution including `-dist`, `-docs`, and `-schema` zip files (results will be in `build/distributions`)

    ./gradlew dist

# Using Eclipse

To generate Eclipse metadata (.classpath and .project files), do the following:

    ./gradlew eclipse

Once complete, you may then import the projects into Eclipse as usual:

 *File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace*

Browse to the *'spring-integration'* root directory. All projects should import
free of errors.

# Using IntelliJ IDEA

To generate IDEA metadata (.iml and .ipr files), do the following:

    ./gradlew idea

# OSGI Notes

1. Dependency on Third Party Bundles
    Some adapters depend on third party libraries (bundles).
    Spring hosts the Enterprise Bundle Repository (EBR) at
        https://ebr.springsource.com/repository/app/, where you can download
        many third-party JARs as valid OSGi bundles.
    If a particular bundle is not available in Spring's EBR, there are tools
       that can convert a regular JAR to a bundle JAR. One of them is Bundlor
       http://www.springsource.org/bundlor which can auto-generate an OSGi
       MANIFEST.MF as part of standard project lifecycle or simply convert a
       non-bundle JAR to a bundle JAR.
2. Boot delegation
    Some adapters depend on extension packages that are available to the boot
    class loader. As a case in point, the Feed Adapter depends on
    com.sun.syndication.feed. Since by default OSGi only loads java.* from the
    boot class loader, other packages that must be loaded from the boot class
    loader can therefore be specified with the
    'org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation' System property.
    For example:
        org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation=com.sun.*,org.w3c.*. . . .
